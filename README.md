# [SoundCloud Queue](http://soundcloudqueue.morgan.io)
Queue up the songs that you want to hear next. The goal of this project is to be able to create an "on-the-go" playlist for your stream so you can just queue up the songs that you know you'd like to listen to.

## Limitations
* No ability to repost or download

## Notes
* The code is pretty poor at this point. This is quite a hack :)

## Future Work
* Reposting
* Downloading
* Improve code base
* Save your queue as a playlist
