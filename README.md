# [SoundCloud Queue](http://soundcloudqueue.morgan.io)
Queue up the songs that you want to hear next.

## Limitations
* Only displays the first someteen tracks of your stream
* Queue is not persistent

## Notes
* The code is pretty poor at this point. This is quite a hack :)

## Future Work
* Security
* Improve code base
* Save your queue as a playlist
* Load more of the user's stream
* Persist queue for each user
